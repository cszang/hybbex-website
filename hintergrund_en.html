        Beech is the most important deciduous tree species in Bavaria
        and the key species of a variety of beech forest
        ecosystems. It offers a diversity of ecological and economical
        advantages, and is widely accepted as a robust and sustainable
        component of resilient mixed forests in Bavaria. However, an
        increase in frequency (and magnitude) of droughts and late
        frosts is very likely to be observed under climate change
        conditions in Bavaria - climatic extremes to which beech trees
        respond highly sensitive.

          late frost event. The upper panel shows the canopy state at
          May 3rd 2011, just before the late frost event, and the
          lower panel shows the canopy state at May 4th 2011, just
          after the late frost event. The white areas signify regions
          of interests for image analysis to compute the duration of
          canopy recovery.

        HyBBEx investigates temporal legacies of these climate
        extremes, so-called hysteresis effects, which may range from
        dedicated recovery periods to mortality. Additional to
        important and directly practically relevant questions about
        the site-specific implications for growing beech, HyBBEx is
        especially concerned with the ecological perspective, with a
        focus on the carbon balance of beech forests &#8212; because
        hysteresis effects may turn forest ecosystems from carbon
        sinks to carbon sources, and can therefore directly impact
        important ecosystem services.

          Fig. 2: Extraction of tree-ring samples in the Bavarian
          Rhoen. Time series of tree growth derived from tree-ring
          measurements are an important data source for HyBBEx, since
          trees store valuable information about recovery from climate
          extremes in their rings.

        Currently, we know only little about these hysteresis effects,
        and consequently even the most up-to-date ecosystem models
        cannot fully capture the recovery of ecosystem productivity
        after climatic extremes. Therefore, a realistic process-based
        projection of the ecosystem functioning of forests (and more
        specifically beech forests) is currently not possible. HyBBEx
        uses an innovative approach comprising data integration, and
        statistical and dynamical modelling, and model-data-fusion to
        achieve projections of ecosystem dynamics of Bavarian forest
        ecosystems through a better understanding of hysteresis
        effects. This enables HyBBEx to deliver both basic science
        contributions and insights in tree species suitability and
        ecosystem management that can directly be fed back into
        forestry practice. All in all, the project wants to contribute
        considerably to the improved understanding of climate change
        impacts on Bavaria, with a direct benefit for the development
        of regional adaptation strategies.
